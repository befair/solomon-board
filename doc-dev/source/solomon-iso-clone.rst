Flash PI
============
Overview
^^^^^^^^
flash_pi is a script used to flash a rpi image into a new sd. The rpi image contains all software pre-installed and configured to work with the ABB Power One and SMA Sunny Boy inverters.
For more information about the *rpi image* check the document **the-solomon-iso**.

How to use

The first thing is to download the `script`. 
Unzip the file. 



At the start of the script there are three important arguments to pass in input. 
1. The path to the rpi image.
2. The path to the sd.
3. The hostname for the new rpi.
